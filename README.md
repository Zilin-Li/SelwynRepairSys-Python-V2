## Web Application Structure

The web application is structured around Flask routes, each corresponding to a specific functionality within the application. The routes are defined in app.py and render templates located in the templateâ€™s directory, which is further organized into admin and technician subdirectories for role-specific views. Data exchange between the routes and templates is handled through HTTP requests, with data being passed to templates for rendering and received from forms as user input.

## Design Decisions Overview:

This section outlines the pivotal design choices made during the development of the application to ensure its functionality, usability, and security.

### Architecture

- **MVC Pattern**: Adopted the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern with Flask to separate concerns, enhancing maintainability and scalability.

### Routing and Data Handling

- **GET and POST**: Utilized GET requests for data retrieval and POST for actions that modify server state, adhering to HTTP standards for safety and idempotence.
- **Data Validation**: Implemented both client-side and server-side validation for robust data integrity and security.

### Templates and UI

- **Separate Templates**: Opted for separate templates for different functionalities to keep the UI manageable and modular.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Employed IF statements within templates for minor variations, reducing the need for multiple templates for similar views.

### Navigation

- **Intuitive Navigation**: Designed a clear and consistent navigation structure, with a top navigation bar for easy access to main sections.



## Database Questions:

1.  ****What SQL statement creates the job table and defines its fields/columns? (Copy and paste the relevant lines of SQL.)****

```

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS job

(

job_id INT auto_increment PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,

job_date date NOT NULL,

customer int NOT NULL,

total_cost decimal(6,2) default null,

completed tinyint default 0,

paid tinyint default 0,

FOREIGN KEY (customer) REFERENCES customer(customer_id)

ON UPDATE CASCADE

);

```

2.  ****Which line of SQL code sets up the relationship between the customer and job tables?****

```

FOREIGN KEY (customer) REFERENCES customer(customer_id)

ON UPDATE CASCADE

```

3.  ****Which lines of SQL code insert details into the parts table?****

```

INSERT INTO part (`part_name`, `cost`) VALUES ('Windscreen', '560.65');

INSERT INTO part (`part_name`, `cost`) VALUES ('Headlight', '35.65');

INSERT INTO part (`part_name`, `cost`) VALUES ('Wiper blade', '12.43');

INSERT INTO part (`part_name`, `cost`) VALUES ('Left fender', '260.76');

INSERT INTO part (`part_name`, `cost`) VALUES ('Right fender', '260.76');

INSERT INTO part (`part_name`, `cost`) VALUES ('Tail light', '120.54');

INSERT INTO part (`part_name`, `cost`) VALUES ('Hub Cap', '22.89');

```

4.  ****Suppose that as part of an audit trail, the time and date a service or part was added to a job needed to be recorded, what fields/columns would you need to add to which tables? Provide the table name, new column name and the data type. (Do not implement this change in your app.)****

To record the time and date a service or part was added to a job for audit purposes, we can modify the database schema by adding a date time column to the related table. .For instance:

#### For Services Added to a Job:

-   **Table Name**: `job_service`
-   **New Column Name**: `added_datetime`
-   **Data Type**: `DATETIME` or `TIMESTAMP`


#### For Parts Added to a Job:

-   **Table Name**: `job_part`
-   **New Column Name**: `added_datetime`
-   **Data Type**: `DATETIME` or `TIMESTAMP`

5.  ****Suppose logins were implemented. Why is it important for technicians and the office administrator to access different routes? As part of your answer, give two specific examples of problems that could occur if all of the web app facilities were available to everyone.****

- **Data security risks :** If a technician has the same access rights as an office administrator, there is a risk that critical data may be inadvertently modified or deleted. For example, a technician might accidentally delete a customer's record when he only intended to update work details. This can lead to data loss, impacting customer trust and service reliability.

- **Operational confusion and errors :** If no access level is defined, it means that any user can schedule jobs or issue invoices, which can lead to operational confusion. Imagine a scenario where a technician unfamiliar with pricing strategies or scheduling constraints schedules a complex job without proper delivery times, or invokes an incorrect fee. This not only disrupts workflow, but also carries the risk of customer dissatisfaction and financial discrepancies that require additional time and resources to correct.

	By describing access rights, we ensure that each user interacts with the system within the scope of their expertise and responsibilities, protects applications from accidental misuse, and maintains the integrity of operational processes.
